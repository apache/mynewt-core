            Indicates that the full logging facility (not the stub) is present.
            This setting should not be overridden.

    LOG_FCB_SLOT1:
        description: >
            Support logging to FCB located in slot 1.
            This is a thin wrapper over LOG_FCB which should be used if
            destination FCB is located in slot 1 as it can detect when
            a new image is uploaded to this slot and stop logging to
            prevent data corruption.
        value: 0
        restrictions:

            Enables global configuration of minimum log level by module ID.
            Writes with a level less than the module's minimum level are
            discarded.  Enabling this setting requires 128 bytes of bss.

        description: >
            Enable "storage_info" API which keeps track of log storage usage and

            bytes used by entries in log.
        value: 0

    LOG_STORAGE_WATERMARK:
        description: >
            Enable "set_watermark" API which can watermark log by entry index and
            thus allow to e.g. keep track of read items in log e.g. (via newtmgr).
            This also extends information returned by "storage_info" to number of
            bytes used by entries above watermark.
        value: 0
