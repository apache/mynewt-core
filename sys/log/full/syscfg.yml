            Enables the bookmarks optimization for FCB-backed log lookups.  To
            use this optimization, the application must configure FCB logs with

        description: >
            The maximum newtmgr log response length. Note that this does not
            represent the entire length of the response sent as the response
            error code is added to the response after this check is performed.
            If a single log entry exceeds this value the msg contents of the
            log entry will be the following string: error: entry too large
            (xxx bytes) with xxx being the size of the entry. Note that the
            value of 400 is a legacy hard-coded value that the code used to
            limit the size of a response with multiple entries although the
            previous code did not limit the size of a response with only one
            entry in it.

    LOG_STORAGE_WATERMARK:
        description: >
            Enable "set_watermark" API which can watermark log by entry index and
            thus allow to e.g. keep track of read items in log e.g. (via mgmt).
