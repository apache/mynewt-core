            If a single log entry exceeds this value the msg contents of the
            log entry will be the following string: error: entry too large
            (xxx bytes) with xxx being the size of the entry. Note that the
            value of 400 is a legacy hard-coded value that the code used to
            limit the size of a response with multiple entries although the
