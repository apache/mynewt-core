# Ports

This folder contains ports of the Memfault platform dependencies for common SDKs
and RTOS'.

The files within are intended to be used in two ways:

- For many common configurations, port files and include directories can be
  added directly to your build system.
- For further customization, the desired ports can be used as a template that is
  copied into your own project and extended upon.
