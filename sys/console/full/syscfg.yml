            UART console receive buffer size; must be power of 2.
            When enabled, data are received to intermediate ringbuffer and
            processed in task context instead of interrupt. This prevents
            from possible deadlocking when trying to output large amount of
            data directly from RX handler (e.g. when echoing data back).
            Set to 0 to disable (received data are handled in interrupt context)

            With no new data on RTT input, interval to poll for new data will
            be gradually increased up to specified value. Using high interval
            value may affect RTT console responsiveness, using small value may
            affect device performance due to more frequent polling.
