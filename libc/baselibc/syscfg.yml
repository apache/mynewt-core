    BASELIBC_EXECUTE_GLOBAL_CONSTRUCTORS:
        description: >
            Set to 1 if project contains C++ files with global objects that
            that need constructors to be executed before main().
            Setting this to 0 reduces code size if there is no need for global
            constructors call.
            It is still possible to use C++ code when this is set to 0 but
            global variable can be in wrong state.

    BASELIBC_THREAD_SAFE_HEAP_ALLOCATION:
        description: >
            Set to 1 if project requires malloc/calloc/free to be thread safe.

    BASELIBC_DEBUG_MALLOC:
        description: >
            Set to 1 to enable extra debugging for malloc/free calls.
            This will e.g. assert on double-free.
