    BUS_DRIVER_PRESENT:
        description: >
            This indicated that hw/bus package is present in build.
            Do not override this settings.
        value: 1
    BUS_DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS:
        description: >
            Default timeout for locking the bus. This can be overriden per-node.
        value: 1000
    BUS_DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS:
        description: >
            Default timeout for transaction on bus. This is used for simple
            transaction APIs (i.e. without timeout set explicitly)
        value: 50
    BUS_PM:
        description: >
            Enable extra power management capabilities for bus driver. This
            allows for some automatic management of bus device state instead of
            implementing this manually.
        value: 0
    BUS_PM_MODE:
        description: >
            Default power management mode for bus drivers.  When set to AUTO
            bus drivers will take care of turning off controllers when they
            are not needed for some time.
            When set to MANUAL bus driver will not enable/disable controllers
            leaving it to the application code.
            This setting is only valid when BUS_PM == 1.
        choices:
            - AUTO
            - MANUAL
        value: AUTO
    BUS_PM_INACTIVITY_TMO:
        description: >
            Default inactivity time after which bus controller will be disabled (in ticks).
        value: 1

    BUS_STATS:
        description: >
            Enable statistics for bus devices. By default only global per-device
            statistics are enabled. Use BUS_STATS_PER_NODE to enable statistics
            for each node also.
        value: 0
    BUS_STATS_PER_NODE:
        description: >
            Enable per-node statistics for each bus node.
        value: 0
        restrictions: BUS_STATS

    BUS_DEBUG_OS_DEV:
        description: >
            Enable additional debugging for os_dev objects.
            Each os_dev object created by bus driver will be poisoned with
            magic value which is then checked on each operation to ensure
            proper objects are passed to APIs.
        value: 0

    BUS_SYSINIT_STAGE:
        description: >
            System initialization stage for bus package
        value: 100
