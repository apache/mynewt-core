    SPIFLASH_AUTO_POWER_DOWN:
        description: >
            Enables auto power down feature which allows to power down flash
            automatically when not used. It will be also automatically released
            from power down on any access. The power down timeout is configurable
            in runtime to allow for adjusting behavior of this feature depending
            on power state.
            Note: if enabled without OS_SCHEDULING, only automatic release from
                  power down will be supported (i.e. no automatic power down).
