        description: >
            List of comma separated GPIO that should be configured for Network
            Core usage. Can be define numeric or with constants from bsp.h
            eg "LED_1, LED_2" or "1, 2". Further GPIO configuration should be
            done by Network Core.

        description: >
            Set this to one only in case of the bootloader predates TrustZone
            changes. With ARM TrusZone support added NRF_IPC_NS block is used
            for both secure and non-secure application. Pre-TrustZone code
            was always running in secure mode and network core code always
            accessed NRF_IP_S (including code that is running in bootloader).
            NRF_IP_S->GPMEM[] was used to pass address of net core application
            image to net bootloader.
