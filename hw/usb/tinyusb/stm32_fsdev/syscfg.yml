    USB_DP_HAS_EXTERNAL_PULL_UP:
        description: >
            Set this to 1 if hardware has external pull up resistor.
            Setting this changes DP pin to 0 at startup for a fraction
            then device is discovered by host.
        value: 1

    USB_DP_PULLUP_CONTROL_PIN:
        description: >
            Set pin number (other then PA11) that connects 1.5k resistor to D+
        value: -1

        description: >
            1.5 kOhm Resistor can be connected directly to one of the output pins,
            or it can use additional switch to connect resistor.
        choices:
            # Following two cases are used when 1.5k is connected when MCU is down
            # and needs some control pin value to be shorted to ground
            - enable_input_disable_0
            - enable_input_disable_1
            # This is rare case when both disable and enable requires control pin
            # to be connected and set to certain value
            - enable_1_disable_0
            - enable_0_disable_1
            # Current can be drawn directly from control PIN it there is not additional
            # switching hardware element.
            - enable_1_disable_input
            # Case when resistor is connected from MCU pin via inverting transistor
            # current is not drawn from MCU pin.
            - enable_0_disable_input
        value: enable_1_disable_0
