    USBD_DFU_BLOCK_SIZE:
        description: >
            Size of block that will be used during upgrade.
            It must be equal of greater than minimum block size that can be
            erased.
            It is flash dependent. For SPIFLASH typical value is 4096.
            For on-chip flash values can be different.

            Time in seconds needed for automatic image confirmation.
        value: 60
    USBD_DFU_BLOCK_WRITE_TIME:
        description: >
            Time in milliseconds needed for writing block to the device.
            It is used by DFU protocol to inform host about possible write delay.
            It can be increased if flash is very slow.
        value: 1
    USBD_DFU_RESET_TIMEOUT:
        description: >
            Time in milliseconds before devices is reset (when USBD_DFU_RESET_AFTER_DOWNLOAD).
            Time is required to gracefully finish DFU protocol exchange.
            Some messages are not propagated to DFU user code (they are internally processed by
            TinyUSB stack) and rebooting just after download is finished while does not make
            any harm to DFU process, confuses DFU utilities.
        value: 1000
    USBD_DFU_DETACH_TIMEOUT:
        description: >
            Time, in milliseconds, that the device will wait after receipt of the
            DFU_DETACH request.  If this time elapses without a USB reset, then
            the device will terminate the Reconfiguration phase and revert
            back to normal operation.  This represents the maximum time that
            the device can wait (depending on its timers, etc.).  The host may specify a
            shorter timeout in the DFU_DETACH request.
        value: 1000

        description: >
            Set to 1 if boot pin needs internal pull-up resistor.
            Set to 2 if boto pin needs internal pull-down resistor.

        description: >
            Number of time bootloader must detects reset cause by reset pin before
            starting dfu bootloader.
            This can be usefull if board does not have dedicated button that can
            be used to switch to DFU mode during boot.
            Pressing Reset button this number of times will start DFU in bootloader.
        value: 0
