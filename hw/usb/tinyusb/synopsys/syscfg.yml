    USB_DP_HAS_EXTERNAL_PULL_UP:
        description: >
            Set this to 1 if hardware has external pull up resistor.
            Synopsys does have internal pull up that allows to re-enumarate
            without physical disconnection, but it will not work when
            external pull up is present (like on on black_vet6 board).
            Setting this changes pin to GPIO 0 at startup for a fraction
            then device is discovered by host.
        value: 0

        description:
            Set to 1 when PA9 is connected to detect VBus.
