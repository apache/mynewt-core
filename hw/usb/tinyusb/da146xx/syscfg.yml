    DA1469X_USB_VBUS_HANDLING:
        description: >
            Selects how VBUS changes should be detected and propagated
            to TinyUSB stack.
            - auto - VBUS interrupt handler notifies USB stack about
                     VBUS changes and shuts down USB when VBUS is off.
                     Power Domain SYS is acquired when VBUS is present
                     preventing deep sleep. Deep sleep is possible
                     when VBUS is not present.
            - ignore - VBUS is not checked at all. USB stack is notified
                     at start that VBUS is present.
                     Suitable for bus-powered devices.
            - custom - VBUS is not handled by this package at all.  User
                     code will have to call tusb_vbus_changed() and
                     take care of SYS Power Domain acquisition.

        choices:
            - auto
