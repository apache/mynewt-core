            When set to 1, hal_system_reset() reboots by jumping to start of flash.
            When set to 0, hal_system_reset() jumps directly to _reset_handler of
            application skipping bootloader code.
            This maybe useful when .bssnz section is being used to store data across
            software reboots.
