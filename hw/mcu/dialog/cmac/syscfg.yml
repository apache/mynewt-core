            Allow only 32768Hz on SLP_TIMER. This allows for
            more optimized code, but will use SLP_TIMER only
            if running on XTAL32K.

        description: >
            Wait for SWD attach on startup. This is useful for debugging
            in case something happens during startup. If enabled, CMAC
            will keep spinning until SWD is attached.

    MCU_DEBUG_HCI_EVENT_ON_FAULT:
        description: >
            Enables writing HCI event to C2S mailbox on fault (e.g. HardFault).
            This is a vendor event similar to the one generated on assert. The
            event payload contains few useful registers to help debugging.
        value: 0
    MCU_DEBUG_HCI_EVENT_ON_ASSERT:
        description: >
            Enables writing HCI event to C2S mailbox on assert. This is
            a vendor event equivalent to one generated by NimBLE, but it
            works for any assert anywhere in code. The event payload
            contains file name and line number of a failed assert.

            to 1 on reset (or in case deep sleep did not happen) and to 0 just
            before entering deep sleep. Setting to -1 disabled this feature.
            Only port 0 pins are supported.
