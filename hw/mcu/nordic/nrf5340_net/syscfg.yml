    MCU_TARGET:

            - nRF5340_NET
    MCU_NET_CORE:
        description: >
            Constant value always set to 1.  It allows to have common
            packages for network and application core that do have
            some differences depending on which core they are build for.

    MCU_FLASH_MIN_WRITE_SIZE:
        description: >
            Specifies the required alignment for internal flash writes.
            Used internally by the newt tool.
        value: 1

    MCU_LFCLK_SOURCE:
        description: >
            Selected source for low frequency clock (LFCLK).
        value:
        choices:
            - LFRC      # 32.768 kHz RC oscillator
            - LFXO      # 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator
            - LFSYNTH   # 32.768 kHz synthesized from HFCLK

    MCU_GPIO_USE_PORT_EVENT:
        description: >
            When enabled, hal_gpio will use GPIOTE PORT event instead of PIN
            events for interrupts. This mode may be less accurate (i.e. pulse
            length needs to be longer in order to be detected) but it reduces
            power consumption since it does not require HFCLK to be running.
            Refer to nRF5340 Product Specification document for more details.
        value: 0

    MCU_DEBUG_IGNORE_BKPT:
       description: >
            When enabled, asm(bkpt) will be ignored. If not set, it will hit
            the breakpoint wherever it gets called, For example, reset and crash
       value: 0

    MCU_ICACHE_ENABLED:
        description: >
            Enable instruction code cache
            Default value is 0, so disabled.
        value: 0

    MCU_DEFAULT_STARTUP:
        description: >
            Include default startup code.
            Set to 0 if BSP provides customized startup code.
