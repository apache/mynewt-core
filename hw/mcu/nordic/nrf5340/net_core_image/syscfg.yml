    NET_CORE_IMAGE_TARGET_NAME:
        description: >
            Target name to build for NET core binary for single image build.
            Default is set for nordic_pca10095 bsp and could be changed,
            although right now this targets could be used for other bsp
            that are based on NRF5340 since target build just BLE controller
            without anything specific to pca10095 board.
