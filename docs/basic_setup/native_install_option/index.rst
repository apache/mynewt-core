Native Installation
###################

This section shows you how to install the tools to develop and build
Mynewt OS applications on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows, and run and debug
the applications on target boards. For Mac OS and Linux, you can also
build Mynewt OS applications that run on Mynewt's simulated hardware.
These applications run natively on Mac OS and Linux.

The tools you need are:

-  Newt tool: Tool to create, build, load, and debug Mynewt OS
   applications.

   -  See `Installing the Newt Tool on Mac
      OS </newt/install/newt_mac.md>`__ to install on Mac OS.
   -  See `Installing the Newt Tool on
      Linux </newt/install/newt_linux.md>`__ to install on Linux.
   -  See `Installing the Newt Tool on
      Windows </newt/install/newt_windows.md>`__ to install on Windows.

-  Native toolchain: Native toolchain to compile and build Mynewt OS
   applications that run on Mynewt's simulated hardware on Mac OS and
   Linux.

   (See `Installing Native
   Toolchain </os/get_started/native_tools.md>`__).

-  Cross tools for ARM:

   -  Cross toolchain for ARM to compile and build Mynewt OS
      applications for target boards.
   -  Debuggers to load and debug applications on target boards.

   (See `Installing Cross Tools for
   ARMs </os/get_started/cross_tools.md>`__).

If you would like to use an IDE to develop and debug Mynewt
applications, see `using an IDE to develop Mynewt
Applications </faq/ide.md>`__. You must still perform the native
installation outlined on this page.
