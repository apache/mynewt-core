Apache Mynewt uses the
[Newt](https://www.github.com/apache/mynewt-newt) build and package
management system, which allows you to compose your OS and choose only the
components you need.

This repository contains the core packages of the Apache Mynewt OS, including:

* A Pre-emptive, Real Time OS Kernel
* A open-source Bluetooth 5.0 stack (both Host & Controller), NimBLE, that
completely replaces the proprietary SoftDevice on Nordic chipsets.
<span style="color:red">**NOTE** NimBLE sources were moved to separate [repository](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble).</span>
    - Support for 251 byte packet size
    - Support for all 4 roles concurrently - Broadcaster, Observer, Peripheral and Central
    - Support for up to 32 simultaneous connections.
    - Legacy and SC (secure connections) SMP support (pairing and bonding).
    - Advertising Extensions.
* A flash filesystem, NFFS, which is designed for tiny (128KB->16MB) flashes.
* FatFS
* Flash Circular Buffer
* JSON and CBOR encoding
* Bootloader support
* Remote Software Upgrade
* HAL and BSP infrastructure designed to abstract microcontroller specifics
* Shell and Console support
* Statistics and Logging Infrastructure
* OIC Client and Server

For more information on the Mynewt OS, please visit our website [here](https://mynewt.apache.org/).

## Browsing

If you are browsing around the source tree, and want to see some of the
major functional chunks, here are a few pointers:

- kernel: Contains the core of the RTOS ([kernel/os](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/kernel/os))

- sys: Contains a number of helper libraries for building applications.  Including a
console ([sys/console](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/sys/console))),
shell ([sys/shell](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/sys/shell)))

- mgmt: Contains the management libraries for newtmgr [mgmt/newtmgr](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/sys/newtmgr)), which supports software upgrade and remote fetching of logs and statistics.

- net: Contains the networking packages.  Highlights of the net directory are the NimBLE and IP packages.
[Nimble](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble)
is a full Bluetooth host and controller implementation, that is written
from the ground up for the Apache Mynewt Operating System (due to code moved to
separate repo this folder contains only compatibility package files).
[ip](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/net/ip) is a port of LWIP, a complete IPv4 and IPv6 implementation.

- hw: Contains the HW specific support packages.  Board Support Packages
are located in [hw/bsp](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/hw/bsp),
and the MCU specific definitions they rely on are located in
[hw/mcu](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/hw/mcu).
There is a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) stored in
[hw/hal](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/hw/hal), even
though the implementation of various HALs are stored in the MCU specific definitions.  Finally, drivers can be found in [hw/drivers](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/hw/drivers).  Drivers provide a higher-level interface to the hardware than the HAL, and may require the Mynewt operating system to function.

- fs: Contains the FS package ([fs/fs](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/fs/fs))
which is the high-level Apache Mynewt file system API.   A specific implementation of that FS, is
[NFFS](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/fs/nffs) (Newtron
Flash File System.)  The Newtron file system is a FS that has been built from
the ground-up in Apache Mynewt, designed to be optimized for small
(64KB-32MB) flashes.
The fs directory also contains [fcb](http://mynewt.apache.org/latest/os/modules/fcb/fcb/), a flash circular buffer implementation.

## Sample Applications

In addition to some of the core packages, there are also some sample
applications that show how to instantiate the Apache Mynewt system.  These
sample applications are located in the `apps/` directory.  They include:

* [boot](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/boot):
  Project to build the bootloader for test platforms.
* [blinky](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/blinky): The
  minimal packages to build the OS, and blink a LED!
* [slinky](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/slinky): A
  slightly more complex project that includes the console and shell libraries.
* [blecent](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/blecent): A basic central device with no user interface.  This
application scans for a peripheral that supports the alert notification
service (ANS).  Upon discovering such a peripheral, blecent connects and
performs a characteristic read, characteristic write, and notification subscription.
* [blehci](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/blehci): Implements a BLE controller-only application.  A separate
host-only implementation, such as Linux's BlueZ, can interface with this
application via HCI over UART.
* [bleprph](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/bleprph): An
  implementation of a minimal BLE peripheral.
* [btshell](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/btshell): Shell interface to the Apache Mynewt Bluetooth stack.
* [bleuart](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/bleuart):
Implements a simple BLE peripheral that supports the Nordic
UART / Serial Port Emulation service
(https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v8.x.x/doc/8.0.0/s110/html/a00072.html).
* [test](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-core/tree/master/apps/test): Test
  project which can be compiled either with the simulator, or on a per-architecture basis.
  Test will run all the package's unit tests.
